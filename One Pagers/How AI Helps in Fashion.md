AI helps fashion retailers manage their inventory by predicting which items will sell best. This ensures that popular products are always available and reduces waste.

## 5. Sustainable Fashion
AI can help design more sustainable clothing by optimizing the use of materials and reducing waste. This contributes to a more eco-friendly fashion industry.

## 6. Custom Fit
AI can create custom-fit clothing by analyzing your body measurements. This ensures that clothes fit perfectly, making you feel more comfortable and confident.
